        <p class="text">I made this website for us. I wanted something that could be felt by both of us in different ways. Words alone can’t express how I feel for you, this is something that holds greater emotion and memories. Every page, picture, and clip is a small piece of moments that somehow became whole stories in my heart. I didn’t do this for attention, perfection, or to prove anything. I did it so you could somehow see how I see you, through my eyes. Even in the little clips of your smile or random moments, every ordinary day becomes magically extraordinary when it’s you in it. The ways of the heart can’t be explained, it does what it wants. But I’ve learned that sometimes we can guide what our heart feels. You’ve shown me that love doesn’t have to be loud. I’ve learned from you that sometimes silence isn’t enough, so this is me saying everything I’ve never been able to say. You changed how I see time. With you, I know what peace feels like, not loud or dramatic, but steady, real, and kind. You made my simple days sacred, and I wish I cherished them more than I did. The thought of us has become a way of life. I don’t know what the future looks like, but I know it’s softer when I imagine it with you. If this website could talk, it would say everything I never could, every emotion I didn’t express, every side glance when I thought you weren’t looking, every cute laugh and quiet moment that made me sure I’m exactly where I want to be. So here’s a small world I built for you, because love shouldn’t just live in memory. It should have a place you can visit. And that place is here.

        <p class="text">I remember something about this day that still stays in my mind. It wasn’t crazy or extraordinary; it was just us having our time in the auditorium, talking and having our normal silence, just us. You were laughing at something I said, and for a second, everything else cleared from my mind. It’s really wild how calm moments can say the most. I was thinking right before we took this picture, I was really shy, that’s why my face isn’t even showing. I thought about us growing up and having kids. I think this was the first time I went that far, and I loved the feeling. I was so happy thinking about getting on my knees someday and asking you to spend the rest of your life with me. I felt that simple kind of peace that only feels right when you’re with someone who makes the world feel slower, softer. I didn’t realize it then, but that moment was becoming a memory, one I’d go back to again and again up till today. There’s a quiet beauty in days like that, where little things like this happen, but it’s really nothing, and somehow it’s everything.

        <p class="text">This day still lives quietly in my heart. I remember how happy and shy I felt just being beside you, your presence made everything around me feel lighter. You looked so beautiful, and even when the whole world felt new, busy, and noisy, you made it feel so familiar. I felt your love, and it was warm. I know I left you alone after it all to go meet my family. I thought it was nothing then, until you told me what I did, and I felt really bad because that small moment was actually a big deal. I should’ve stayed with you, waited with you, shared every second with you. Our love was still new, and I was still learning how to breathe, still learning how to please your heart and to be the man who stays, even when the world drags me everywhere you’re not. There are plenty of moments like this that I still regret to this day, maybe because I was shy, not confident, just a little oblivious toward my world. This day will always remind me of how young we were, not in age but in understanding. I didn’t leave because I didn’t care, I left because I didn’t yet understand how much being beside you mattered. Looking back now, I realize you are my calm in the noise, and I wish I had held onto that peace a little longer, because I still dream of having you beside me every single day.

        <p class="text">ahhh this video, this memory always makes me happy because it is just us with no filters, no plans, no trying too hard to impress each other, just the small random things that somehow became our connection. you teasing me about my phone camera which was a 13 by the way, trying to persuade me to get my clothes (stealing them indirectly), doing that cute move that makes me happy, not caring about people even though they were watching, you still being the cutest in the room. you eating, laughing, touching my hair, in the first clip you were playing with something down thereッ, all those things that seemed so lame at the time now feel like gold. i didn’t know back then that these tiny moments would mean so much later. even your fake cries, you not letting me get a kiss, then me stealing it before you could move, all of it shows how love can be the best when unplanned. this wasn’t perfection, it was real, it was laughter, closeness, mischief, and peace all tangled together. it’s still crazy how all this makes my heart feel after two years, i feel full and sometimes forget all my regrets, then i look at the bright side which is our future together and how i’m going to make it what our past couldn’t be.

        <p class="text">i don’t even know how to describe this day without smiling first.That week felt heavier than most, everything we did suddenly meant more because i knew you’d be leaving soon. when i came to your church that day, i was trying to act normal, trying not to show how much my heart was already breaking. we were at the back of your church and you were making a video of us kissing, i acted weird which made you delete it, as you can hear me scream cause i wasnt happy you deleted it. We talked, laughed, played around, and tried to pretend that everything was still normal. i kept stealing glances at you, memorizing everything, your smile, the way you looked at me, the sound of your voice. i knew i was going to miss all of it soon. you then peed and we tried to go in but you had to take pictures of some women, i also have videos of that u\you were really cute, i remember thinking that if time stopped right there, i’d be fine. then it happened, the moment that sealed that day forever in my mind, the one thing that made me realize that even when life tries to pull us apart, what we share is still stronger than distance.</p>

        <p class="text">i hope you remember this night, it really hit different. we were walking behind block A, beside the place we almost got SAMAJ, and we were both just so happy to be there. we stayed out really late, even after they chased everyone in, and that’s when i took these pictures. i have more, and they all came out beautiful, i’m really glad i took them. you looked so cute that night, you didn’t even try to stun but somehow you got every bit of my attention. we talked about everything and nothing, walking with no real destination trying to not get chased back to our hostel, just us and the night. the lights gave this soft glow to your skin, your lips looked so enticing, your hair was perfect, and your eyes were literally shining. you need to see the other pictures, my daysss, i can’t even remember seeing anyone else, just you. and that’s a feeling i’ll hold onto forever. i remember looking at the pictures right after and thinking how beautiful they were, not because of the background, your dress, or the aesthetics, but because of you. Your smile made the moment feel alive. the night wasn’t special because of what we did, it was special because of how it felt, simple, calm, relaxed, and full of love.</p>

        <p class="text">This video always makes me smile every time i watch it, i remember walking back to my hostel that night feeling like i just left a dream. i couldn’t stop filming because i didn’t want the feeling to fade. your lipstick marks were everywhere, on my lips, cheeks, forehead, even my neck, and i couldn’t stop laughing. my friends wouldn’t let me rest, they kept shouting that i’d been “baptized in love” and that i was a “finished man.” i didn’t care, not one bit. i was too happy to clean it off. that night was simple but it stayed with me, it felt like proof that love can leave traces you never want to wash away, both on your skin and in your heart. i’d give anything just to taste your soft lips again, even for a second.</p>

        <p class="text">I’ve always loved taking random pictures of you when you weren’t looking, my camera roll has a lot of unaware pics I took of you, lol. I’m sure you never understood why I love asking for your pictures, you may think I just want them just to have them, or that I’m asking for asking sake, but no, I genuinely need to have your pictures. they hold a special place in my heart too. when I get sad, I go look at how pretty my girl is, when I miss you, I go through the album I made specifically for you. it’s like a coping mechanism, especially now that you’re thousands of miles away. I use them to keep myself from falling into the void. I really miss the opportunities I had when you were in school, now I can’t even take pictures of you, only FaceTime photos, and they don’t hit as much (I also have a surprise when I come to Canada, hehe). whenever I ask for your pictures, I want you to know that it’s deeper than just you sending them and me keeping them. they go a long way for me. I bond with them, as weird as it sounds, I talk to your pictures when I can’t talk to you. like a few days before our anniversary, I kept talking to your pictures, and it actually helped me. I always remember how lucky I am to witness these small pieces of you that no one else sees. it’s like freezing time for a second, just to hold onto how it feels to love you when you’re not even looking.

        <p class="text">Making this video was so cute and it still cracks me up every single time I watch it. this fan that took fifty years to finally get into your hands, I swear, I got it twice and misplaced the first one, so I kept stalling. remember I told you it was blue? me getting that fan was a whole journey on its own. you were unboxing it and talking, acting like it was some grand gift, being all sassy because I lied and took forever to get it to you. I couldn’t stop smiling, I finally gave you the fan, lol. I loved how you liked it, the relief I felt that day was crazy. you were giving full YouTube review energy, peak “you and camera” moment. I just kept thanking God for letting me love you, even while you were roasting me for taking months to deliver a fan. we laughed, talked, ate our food — and by the way, in the future, learn to *remain food*, why would I be the one saving food for you? 😂 it wasn’t even a big gift, but you made it feel like a million-dollar present. that moment was simple, funny, and pure — one of those priceless memories that’ll stick with me forever.

        <p class="text">I cannot stop thinking of you, babe, No matter what I do, I can’t seem to get you out of my mind. My thoughts keep drifting back to you, your voice, your laughter, the way you look at me. You’re always there, somewhere between my thoughts and my heartbeat. I miss hearing your voice and seeing that priceless smile on your face. It’s gotten to the point where I yearn for you on a deeper level. There’s hardly a moment when you’re not on my mind. I think about you all the time, and I love every second we spend together. I’m already looking forward to seeing you again, to being near you once more. That moment still lingers in my mind, not just because of what happened, but because of how it felt. It wasn’t only about touch; it was about connection, the kind that makes time slow down and everything else fade away. It was then I realized how much our closeness truly meant, how being near you could make the world feel both calm and electric at once. You had that shy smile afterward, the one that said everything words couldn’t. It’s one of those quiet, unspoken memories that still burns softly in my heart, not because it was wild or loud, but because it was ours. Real. Unforgettable.</p>

        <p class="text">This evening when we were leaving the auditorium, you did this lil fake cry when i was recording, i wonder why you got scared when you noticed i was recording, it was one of those moments that didn’t feel like much then but now it’s a memory i’ll always remember cause i can’t experience you this way anymore, even though i was always shy i still tried to knock myself out of it cause i thought about how you’d feel, maybe you’d think about how someone would treat you better, it was a huge challenge for me but i was determined to give you the best of me, so i strived to be comfortable when i’m around you and it worked, i can be careless, off the edge, off guard, very vulnerable, silly, and it still feels perfect, i think about that sometimes, how little things could carry crazy weight, it wasn’t about knocking sense into myself it was about feeling safe, feeling close, acting weird, knowing no matter what, we’d always find a reason to smile together.</p>

        <p class="text">this day, september 7th, will always stay with me because it was filled with every emotion possible. it was two days after you told me you were leaving for canada, and i can still remember how my heart shattered the moment those words left your mouth. i cried instantly, not because i was angry, but because i never saw it coming. i thought you were about to say you didn’t want to be with me anymore because of your parents, and i was already bracing for that pain. but hearing that you were relocating felt even heavier. if you had said you wanted to break up, i could’ve fought for you, found a way to see you again, but this,this felt like losing something I couldn’t reach no matter how much I loved you. after you told me, we spent the next few days in this strange space between sadness and gratitude, trying to find peace in the middle of heartbreak. two days later, we decided to meet in your church. that was the first day you met my mum and aunty hannah. i still remember watching you from inside the car before you noticed me — my heart just melted. that day felt magical in a quiet, emotional way. we spoke about breaking up and staying together, and i was torn inside, but one thing i knew for sure was that i was still deeply in love with you and didn’t want to let go. seeing you walk across the stage, watching you move, smile, and sing — i cried every time you stood up and wiped my face before you came back. you brought peace to a heart that was breaking. we laughed, joked, and talked, even with sadness sitting quietly between us. and yes, i still remember touching the waterッ — it makes me laugh every time. when the day was ending, i realized i couldn’t let you go. even though part of me felt you might’ve wanted to end things to protect yourself, you didn’t. you stayed. and for that, i will always be grateful. i called my mum, and when she came, i knew it was time. saying goodbye felt unreal. we kissed, i walked away, but my heart didn’t move. so i turned back and kissed you again because i needed one last moment that would remind me that even in goodbye, love was still alive. that day will forever be one of the most emotional yet beautiful memories of my life. i wasn’t happy you were leaving, but i was thankful that love won that day. you didn’t break up with me — you chose us. and that choice has carried me every single day since. i love you endlessly.</p>

        <p class="text">This picture reminds me that someday, we’ll get married, but it also reminds me of what I should’ve done a long time ago. every time I think about you, babe I realize there are things I never gave you properly. I never gave you a moment like this, the one you truly deserved. I never asked you to be my girlfriend. I just let life carry us, believing love alone was enough, thinking our connection didn’t need words to make it real. the truth is, you are my girl, but I never asked you out because deep down, I was scared. we grew too close, too fast, and I felt that if I asked, it would give you a choice, the one I was terrified of. I thought silence would protect us, but it only left a space that words should’ve filled. you didn’t deserve to be assumed into my life, you deserved to be chosen, clearly, proudly, and beautifully. I’m so sorry I never gave you that moment. when I come to canada, I’ll make it right. I’ll ask you properly, in a way that shows how much you’ve always meant to me. I’ll make it unforgettable, because you’ve always deserved that and more.</p>

        <p class="text">This was the last day we had in school, it was so crazy — everything was just heavy. my heart, my soul, even the air. the night before was magical, us walking down the road and crying together lol. it was so cute, then we saw ella and i was hiding my face so she wouldn’t see my red eyes. and then we kept walking. i didn’t want to kiss or hug for the last time, i really wasn’t in the mood, i just wished you weren’t going to leave. i know i made you feel somehow when i didn’t kiss you how i normally do, my mind was too busy thinking of how to cope, i didn’t notice i was neglecting you and your last kiss. it wasn’t intentional, baby. i remember us standing and hugging in silence. i always wondered what was going through your mind while we stood there. me, i was just thinking about my life alone without the love of my life. i was so unhappy. but on the brighter side, i wasn’t losing you forever, it was just for a long short period of time. the next day came and we did our last activity before heading to your hostel to carry your bags. then we met some of our coursemates, they had no idea that’d be the last time they’d see you in person. we went to the gate and you said i should follow you. even though i was confused, i still followed you to the back of the volleyball court. and then you kissed me so good, my heart stopped aching for a moment. i really loved how your lips connected to mine, till date, that’ll be the best kiss i’ve ever had in my life. we were running out of time, so we had our last chat, trying to laugh and joke even in the storm. then i made the video of you walking out the gate, and i thought you wouldn’t look back, but you did. and i stopped recording so i could enjoy that memory properly instead of just recording. you waved and i said “byeeee,” then i knew it was over and i was fucked. i watched you get on the bike but you didn’t look back again. i was so heartbroken. i wish we had more time together, but i guess everything God does is for the best. you made my life in that school the best, and i would never forget you.</p>

        <p class="text">This day was honestly one to remember, everything that could go wrong almost did, I still laugh when I think about how I went to the wrong address first, standing there so confused like, “wait, you’re taking too long to come out,” I was stressing so bad, checking my phone every second, praying I was tripping and you were just too busy to come out, I cried so hard after you told me it was the wrong one I went to, I didn’t want to mess up our plans, and then boom, I felt so stupid but all I could think about was getting to you, you then said go home it’s fine, but I wasn’t that stupid to actually go home, I finally got the right address, I overpaid like a bitch, I didn’t even care, I just wanted to get there fast, my head was spinning, my heart pounding, tears running down my face cause I fucked up really bad, I kept imagining your face waiting, I remember feeling bad for coming late, I kept replaying it in my mind like I could somehow make time move backwards and get the right address, but when I finally saw you, everything just stopped, all that stress, the rushing, the confusion, it didn’t matter at all, you smiled at me and I felt so cold inside instantly, the day didn’t go as planned but somehow it turned out perfect after I saw you, we laughed, hugged, and we made this memory that makes my chest warm up, it’s crazy that the chaos turned into something beautiful, I guess that’s just what happens when it’s us, no matter how off things go, it always ends up feeling right, that day taught me something, that even when I’m late, lost, or broke, I’ll still find my way to you, one way or another, "footballerrr".

        <p class="text">This was one of the last videos of us being together, and honestly, every time I watch it, I feel that same ache in my chest. we were at the amusement park, laughing, hugging, holding on to each other like time would wait for us. the lights, the music, the noise,yahaya, none of it mattered. it was just us, caught in our own world, pretending the night would never end. we hugged softly, and I held on to you like I’d miss you forever. it could’ve been our last hug ever, and I couldn’t let that happen fr. saying goodbye was so hard. but now, when I watch this, I don’t see the end, I see our promise. I see the future we keep talking about. I see us finding our way back to each other in Canada, waking up in our huge yard, surrounded by the life we built from love and patience. I see us sitting on our couch, talking about how far we’ve come — how we once cried over phone calls, how we missed each other so much it hurt, how we broke down and built ourselves back up together. every tough moment would be worth it. I see our kids running around, laughter filling every corner, love written on every wall of our home. we’d both be doing great in our careers, living the dreams we once spoke about like fairytales. and when the nights get quiet, we’ll look at each other and smile, knowing we made it back together. watching this now, I don’t just see the end of something, I see the beginning of everything we’re meant to be. it hurts, but it also gives me hope. because no matter how far apart we are, I know somehow, everything will lead me back to you. I love you so much, my Lore, and I’d do anything to come back to you. I can’t wait to fulfill my duties as your man, to keep protecting you, our relationship, and our future.</p>
